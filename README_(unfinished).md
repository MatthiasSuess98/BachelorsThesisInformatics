### gpve -- GPU-Core Perfomance Variation Explorer
With this project the Performance Variations of GPU cores of a specific GPU can be explored.


## Pre-requisites
- cmake 3.22 or higher
- nvcc 11.0 or higher


## Compatibility
- Tested on Nvidia Kepler, Pascal, Turing, Ampere GPUs.
- Primarilly developed for Linux, but should also work on Windows (however, not actively tested there).


## Installation
The installation of gpve is primary done via Cmake.

# Pull latest version of cuda-samples git submodule:
git submodule update --init

# Build and install the benchmarking executable for a specific microarchitecture:
mkdir build && cd build



















cmake -DNVIDIA_UARCH="<version>" ..
# build options:
# -DNVIDIA_UARCH options are: KEPLER, MAXWELL, PASCAL, VOLTA, TURING, AMPERE, HOPPER
# -DIsDebug=1                           - turns on debug output
# -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=../inst-dir    - to install locally into the git repo folder
make all install

## Running the Benchmarks

Run the benchmarsk with

```
../inst-dir/mt4g
# options:
#   -p:<path>:
#   	Overwrites the source of information for the number of Cuda Cores
# 	<path> specifies the path to the directory, that contains the 'deviceQuery' executable
#   -p: Overwrites the source of information for the number of Cuda Cores, uses 'nvidia-settings'
#   -d:<id> Sets the device, that will be benchmarked
#   -l1: Turns on benchmark for l1 data cache
#   -l2: Turns on benchmark for l2 data cache
#   -txt: Turns on benchmark for texture cache
#   -ro: Turns on benchmark for read-only cache
#   -c: Turns on benchmark for constant cache
```
If multiple GPUs are installed, you need to compile to the correct compute capability and then specify the device ID with the flag -d:
- `./mt4g -d:1` executes the tool using the GPU with deviceID 1
You can obtain the device ID again by calling `nvidia-smi` and checking the _GPU_ flag.

When the benchmarks are over (usually in 5-15 min), the final output is stored in "`GPU_Memory_Topology.csv`".

## Known issues/limitations

- For pascal microarchitecture, the process may evaluate L1 cache as not present (output in stdout "[L1_L2_DIFF.CUH]: Compare average values: L1 242.530000 <<>> L2 242.560000, compute absolute distance: 0.030000", where the L1 and L2 values are very similar) -- try building mt4g with a makefile instead (`make`).
- On Volta and Ampere, the L1/Texture/Readonly cache size is measured about 6â€“8 KiB less than the actual value (32KiB).
